              My name is Will Arrowsmith, and I’m a final-year Business Economics student at the University of Exeter. I’m a creative and proactive problem solver with a talent for crafting innovative, user-friendly solutions. I’m passionate about developing accessible products that make a meaningful impact.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              My internship at Intel introduced me to product management, where I managed digital tools for the pricing team. Since, I’ve helped Exeter University launch and improve their student app, "MyExeter", and created "PeerPitch", an app similar to a dating app but for skill-sharing and collaboration among students.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Outside of work, my interests include music, fitness, and cooking. I love challenging myself to learn new things. I taught myself piano up to grade 7 using YouTube and have recently started producing music to further explore my passion. I have also been learning to code, using skills gained to build this website. I stay active through running, regular gym sessions, and playing Padel—a new favourite with me and my housemates !
